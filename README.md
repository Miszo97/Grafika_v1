# Grafika_v1
The project files

I've created a program which analyses images in three diferent states (oryginal, nosiy, filtred). The program allows user to deal demage 
particular image. Once they did it. They can use two of filters FASTAMF and VMF to filtr the image and get rid of noise. User can also save 
images if they want.

## Loage an image
You are able to load (.png .jpg .bmp) formats. Just click the pointed button. The program will automatically set it to the first window.
