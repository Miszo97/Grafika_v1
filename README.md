*Load a image, Deal a damage, Filrt the Image, Save the image*

I've created a program which analyses images in three diferent states (oryginal, nosiy, filtred). The program allows user to deal demage 
particular image. Once they did it. They can use two of filters FASTAMF and VMF to filtr the image and get rid of noise. User can also save 
images if they want.

## Load an image
You are able to load (.png .jpg .bmp) formats. Just click the pointed button. The program will automatically set it to the first window.

## Deal demage to the image.
This is the moment when you can damage your image with a noise generator. It has two options CIRI and CTRI.Set the saturation of noise by typing how muny pixels should be damaged.

## Use two of filters to get rid of noise
You can choose either VMF filter or FASTAMF filter to remove unwanted noise from image.

# Note

Program works thanks to coplex algorythms and math formulas. It's hard to describes all the feautres of the program like Winsize or ProgVal. You can leave it as it is.
